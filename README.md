# Embedded Calculator using GPIO and LCD Interface

This repository contains the source code for a simple embedded calculator that utilizes GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) and an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) interface. The project is implemented with a layered architecture to perform basic arithmetic calculations.

## Project Overview

The embedded calculator application allows users to input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /) through a keypad. It then performs the specified arithmetic operation and displays the result on an LCD screen.

The project demonstrates the following features:
- GPIO integration for keypad input.
- LCD interface to display input and output.
- Layered architecture to structure the code.
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Getting Started

To run this project on your embedded hardware, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment and toolchain as per your hardware platform and microcontroller.

2. Ensure you have the necessary GPIO and LCD libraries for your hardware.

3. Clone this repository to your development environment:
   
   git clone https://github.com/engessam/Embedded_Simple_Calculator.git
   

4. Build and flash the project onto your microcontroller.

5. Connect the keypad and LCD according to your hardware configuration.

6. Run the application on your embedded system.

## Usage

1. Launch the calculator application on your embedded system.

2. Enter the first number using the keypad. You can input up to a 3-digit number.

3. Press the operator key (+, -, *, or /) to specify the operation you want to perform.

4. Enter the second number using the keypad

5. Press the '=' key to perform the calculation.

6. The result will be displayed on the LCD screen.

7. Repeat steps 1-6 for additional calculations.
